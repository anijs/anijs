# AniJS

Declarative handling library for CSS animations. The main objective is to provide an elocuent, easy to translate, and quick to develop environment.


## Try It!!

Check the online [Demostration](http://anijs.github.io/).


## Installation
 
**Bower**
```bash
$ bower install anijs
```

**Forked on [Github](https://github.com/anijs/anijs)**
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:anijs/anijs.git
```

**Download as [Zip](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/archive/master.zip)**

 
## Usage
 
Put the AniJS file on your page.
```xml
<script src="anijs-min.js"></script>
```

Include the CSS animation styles definition, we strongly recomend you  to use the amazing [animate.css library](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) as starting point, this library provides beautiful animations. Also, you can define your own animations.

```xml
<head>
    <!-- Animate.css library -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/animatecss/3.1.0/animate.css">
</head>
```

Start playing by adding **anijs-data** tag to any HTML element.
```xml
<body>
    <header data-anijs="if: click, do: flipInY animated, after: removeAnim">
        header
    </header>
    <nav data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: swing animated, to: footer">
        nav
    </nav>
    <div id="main" data-anijs="if: DOMContentLoaded, on: document, do: swing animated">
        if: DOMContentLoaded, on: document, do: swing animated, after: removeAnim
    </div>
    <footer>
        footer
    </footer>
    <script src="bower_components/anijs/dist/anijs-min.js"></script>
</body>
```

If you use [animate.css library](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) don't forget to add  the **animated** class in the **do** definition. However, using the [**setClassNamesWhenAnim**](https://github.com/anijs/anijs/wiki/Add-default-class-names-while-Anim) function, AniJS can do that for you. 


```xml
<body>
    <header data-anijs="if: click, do: flipInY animated">
     <!-- ... -->
    </header>
 </body>
```
### RequireJS
index.html

```xml
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.11/require.js" data-main="app" ></script>
 </body>
```

app.js

```javascript
require(["anijs"], function(AniJS) {
});
```
